--8 Constraints: What are they? What are they good for? Advantage?
-- Contraints are limitations or rules used for data in a table. They are good so that the 
-- user entering in sql commands does not do something really stupid and break the database or
-- deleting everything by accident. They are good for keeping someone from deleting something they arent
-- supposed to delete. The CAP3 database for example, if you try deleting an agent from the 
-- agents table postgres will not let you because agents are used in the orders table therefore
-- you have to delete those (the children) first. Alan says that you can kill the children, not
-- the parents (not actual people).
